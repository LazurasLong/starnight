            <p>It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there had been no wild legends at all
                since the witch trials, and even then these western woods were not feared half so much as the small
                island in the Miskatonic.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Sagittarius</h2>
            <p> He could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime,
                against a window opening on the morning sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent
                mist against the black and blasted landscape. </p>

        <div class="right">
            <h2 class="title">Cassiopeia</h2>
            <p> These were not haunted woods, and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days. Then
                there had come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in the air, and that pillar of smoke
                from the valley far in the wood.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Lacerta</h2>
            <p>It wasn't right—it was against Nature—and he thought of those terrible last words of his stricken friend,
                "It come from some place whar things ain't as they is here... one o' them professors said so..."</p>
